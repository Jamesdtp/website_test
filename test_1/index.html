        <p><strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong> is a 2022 American absurdist comedy-drama film written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as "Daniels"), who co-produced it with the Russo brothers. It stars <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong> as a Chinese-American woman being audited by the Internal Revenue Service who discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from causing the <em>destruction of the <strong>multiverse</strong></em>. Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis appear in supporting roles. The film has been described as a <strong>"swirl of genre anarchy"</strong>[5] and features elements of black comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts film and animation.</p>
